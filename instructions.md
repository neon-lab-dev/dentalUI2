In this project we are using the easy appointments api to create appointments.
but we also have our own api setup for the same purpose.

i want to omit the dental backend and totally use the easy appointments api.

providers will be fetched from the easy appointments api.
    we have 4 City categories in our UI (location page), so we will fetch all providers and divide them among each city .
services , service details will be fetched from the easy appointments api.
provider's availability on date and time will be fetched from the easy appointments api.
previous appointments will be fetched from the easy appointments api.

# we already have create booking and create customer api's in place 
# we already have UI in place for all necessary pages. we will not change the UI.

we will work on the frontend api and data part only.
